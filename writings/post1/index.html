Our brains are carefully (and sometimes seemingly randomly) collecting and storing informations, ranging from personal experiences to learnt facts and knowledge. I believe <strong>prioritising asking the right questions and listening actively, promotes a culture of learning</strong>, furthermore allowing us to have a direct influence on our assembled data.</p><p>I dedicate my first article to the first part of the data visualisation process - <strong>know the questions you want to answer</strong>. Because a good question, such as a good data viz, is a conversation starter, and - let’s hope - a catalyst for change.</p><p>My goal is to share my perspective on the value of both <strong>asking questions and attending to the answers we receive</strong>. I wish to answer, paradoxically, the question on what makes a good question. Whether a good question for forming a hypothesis and collecting, analysing, and visualising data for, or a good question for sharing our personal data and <strong>constructed opinions</strong>. These are few of my current collected answers, inspirations and valuable resources.</p><p>=============</p><h2 id=crafting-questions>Crafting Questions</h2><p><strong>The <em>right</em> versus <em>good</em> questions</strong></p><p>In “<a href=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33854/33854-h/33854-h.htm>Ask a foolish question</a>” short story by Robert Sheckley, 1953, the prologue starts:</p><p><em>It&rsquo;s well established now that the way you put a question often determines not only the answer you&rsquo;ll get, but the type of answer possible. So &mldr; a mechanical answerer, geared to produce the ultimate revelations in reference to anything you want to know, might have unsuspected limitations.</em></p><p>The moral of the story, <em>In order to ask a question you must already know most of the answer,</em> guide towards a definition of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_question>research question</a> : being <em><strong>narrow</strong></em>, <em><strong>specific</strong></em>, and carefully expanding the shore of our island of knowledge bit by bit. <strong>Falsifiability</strong> of <strong>research</strong> questions and hypothesis is a standard method for evaluating question’s logicality introduced by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science>philosopher of science</a> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper>Karl Popper</a> in his book &ldquo;<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</a>&rdquo; (1934). A brief side note - this is a quite helpful and surprisingly often forgotten tool to separate science between non-science and pseudo-science ("<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3272165-bad-science>Bad Science</a>", by Ben Goldacre).</p><p>Generally, questions are divided into open ended (Qualitative research) and close ended, also called yes-no questions (Quantitative research). This is a division used also as a categorisation step in the Question Formulation Technique, or QFT developed by organisation <em><a href=https://rightquestion.org/what-is-the-qft/>the Right Question Institute</a> .</em> As the institute’s name suggest, this is also a good place to start with finding the <em>right</em> question. The QTF steps are :</p><ol><li>Write as many questions as you are curious to research.</li><li>Categorise into qualitative and quantitative questions.</li><li>Consider the value of each question and consider changing from one type to another. Identify advantages and disadvantages.</li><li>Prioritise your questions: what do you need to know? What is the scope ? How many questions can you get answered? How will you process the collected information? Which answers have biggest impact?</li></ol><p>Following these steps invites both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTr12dK2Se0&ab_channel=Sprouts">diffuse and focus thinking</a> which is helpful in understanding better the research objective (what we are curious about) and narrowing the questions into their correct final form (how we ask for it).</p><p>Another valuable resource for planning and writing questionnaires, (which are - simply said - collections of questions) is <a href=https://davidfharris.com/><em>The Complete Guide To Writing Questionnaires</em></a> by David F. Harris. It helped me to train my question-formulation muscle, especially for collecting UX data.</p><p>So far, the above mentioned resources help to think, brainstorm and choose the <em>right</em> questions within the scientific field, journalism and for preparing user research. With “<em>right</em>” I wish to communicate the need to limit the type and scope of questions available for the intended research. Having said that, I can tell, it might be quite easy to become a frustrated truth-seeker when only the “<em>right”</em> questions are allowed and can be answered.</p><p>However, when it comes to live interactions, I like to rather think, first of all, about asking <em>good</em> questions instead of <em>right</em>. By reading <a href=https://www.stoneandheen.com/difficult-conversations>Difficult Conversations - How to discuss what matters most</a> and attending <a href=https://authenticrelating.co/five-practices/>Authentic Relating Training</a>, my current subjective definition of a <em>good</em> question is : <em>A question that invites vulnerability and inspires reflection</em>. Here, the crafted questions are important to consider both - our awareness of emotional state of both of us and transparency of the question’s aim. A <em>good</em> question might come only after creating certain context, which is important especially during difficult conversations (you might ask me about my break ups..). I believe emotionless discussions on informational level require certain disconnection from the personal opinion and this should not be taken as implicit when crafting questions. Compared to research questions, alive interactions require more improvisation and active listening of our chosen discussion partner.</p><p>Further categorisation of existing open question types: probing, leading, loaded, funnel, recall and process questions, and rhetorical questions. <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/rhetoric-art-persuasive-writing-and-public-speaking?delta=0">A course in rhetorics</a> might be another direction to consider.</p><p>An interesting additional resource for conditioning our curiosity is <a href=https://openmindplatform.org/app-difficult-conversations/>Conversation Stimulator</a> from a team at Open Mind. It gives a chance to practice skills in anticipation of, for example, upcoming holidays with family.</p><p>=============</p><h2 id=attending-to-the-answers>Attending to the Answers</h2><p>Try this: the next time you catch yourself getting ready to make a judgement try asking a question instead. Active listening, meaning allowing a person to speak uninterrupted (and without thinking about our own answer meanwhile), can change the person’s narrative. Rob Walker, author of the beautiful book “<em>The art of noticing</em>”:</p><p>“…There’s always at least one moment <em>when I miss a chance to pursue (or even step on or get in the way of) a source’s smart point or original observation by rushing to (try to) make my own. This is a failure of attention on my part—and a failure of humility, too.”</em></p><p>Ways to signal listening actively:</p><ul><li>Repeat back summary of what was said, best by using synonyms. This invites <em>answerer</em> to further abstract from his thoughts, correct or clarify their statements, and reinforces that what was meant was understood. If unclear, ask follow up questions.</li><li>After more emotional answer, naming what feeling was noticed. Asking if there is more that he/she wishes to share.</li><li>Sharing <em>impact</em> or personal perception on what was said. Yet often we take it as implicit that the person cares about our opinion or additional thoughts. Asking if they wish to hear our thoughts or even advice, underlines our patience towards the person and might invite more curiosity on their side.</li></ul><p>Meanwhile the following note is mostly regarding emotional management rather than part of data practice, it affects the quality with which we are interacting at social interactions. I often find myself wondering, when the conversation feels difficult, it is likely signifying something about me. Either I am reacting to the person themselves or the content of the discussion is threatening my identity, or perhaps I feel dismissed or wronged. Whatever it is, to identify my own triggers I ask myself: “If I know nothing else about myself, I know that I am a BLANK person.“ Recognising and welcoming the BLANK person is first step towards bringing back safety and confidence.</p><p>If you got all the way here I wish that this article provided you with some new insights or ideas to research, whatever they might be about. I always appreciate receiving feedback - it takes a village to raise a person. Otherwise I move on to invite a reflection: Where crafting curious questions and attending to the answers could enrich your life?</p><p>////</p><p>The notion of “critical data practice” is a nod to Philip E. Agre’s notion of “critical technical practice”, which he describes in terms of having “one foot planted in the craft work of design and the other foot planted in the reflexive work of critique” (Agre, 1997, p. 155).</p></div></main></body></html>
