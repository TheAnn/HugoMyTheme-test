Hand drawn data visualisations of my personal data - such as 34 days of my 30 tomatoes growth experiment featured at Georgia's Lupi talk [Finding humanity in data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ&ab_channel=99U), or examples of analog data postcards that we send to each other with a good friend [Slavo](https://www.instagram.com/baca_design/) for a half year. For the latter project, I was inspired by [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), and lured Slavo to collect and draw our personal data for a different theme each week - ranging from tracking our disappointments, feelings, “thank you” we gave and received, number of observed smiles, etc. The challenge was in creatively encoding collected data into visuals that would best fit the theme, while making it intuitive for the reader to decode :)).
